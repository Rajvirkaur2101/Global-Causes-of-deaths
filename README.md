### Analyzing Global Causes of Death

#### Jan 2025 - Feb 2025

Conducted Exploratory data analysis on global mortality data (1990–2019) using Python, Tableau, and Power BI. Addressed key research questions on leading causes of death, changes over time, country-specific mortality rates, and differences between communicable and non-communicable diseases. Performed data cleaning, hypothesis testing, and visualized trends across countries and years. Applied Machine Learning models (Linear Regression, Auto Regressive Integrated Moving Average) to forecast cardiovascular disease trends. Utilized PCA and K-Means Clustering for dimensionality reduction and country segmentation, developing interactive visualizations to support data-driven public health decisions.
